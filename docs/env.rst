Environmental variables
==========================

jps uses below environmental variables. These are optional.
You don't need to set these variables (default will be used.)

- JPS_MASTER_HOST: set default master host. This will be overwritten by args. (default: "localhost")
- JPS_SUFFIX: Add this to all topic names. This is for multi robot system. (default: "")
